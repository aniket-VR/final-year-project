# Body Mass Index from Face Images
 


## Overview

This machine learning project predicts Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) using face images. Users can provide images through live webcam capture or by browsing images from the file explorer.

## Features

- Live image capture from webcam or image upload from file explorer.
- Predicts Height, Weight, and BMI from face images.
- Utilizes popular Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Face Recognition, Tkinter, PIL, and Cassandra.
- Developed as part of the Ineuron internship project, with contributions from Dhruv Mulay.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- cv2
- tensorflow
- logging
- sklearn
- time
- Cassandra
- face_recognition
- tkinter
- PIL


## Usage

1. Run the application.
2. Choose the option to capture a live image from the webcam or upload an image from the file explorer.
3. View the predicted Height, Weight, and BMI based on the provided face image.
